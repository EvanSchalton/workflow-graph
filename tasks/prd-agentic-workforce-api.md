# Product Requirements Document: Agentic Workforce Management API

## Introduction/Overview

The Agentic Workforce Management API is a revolutionary system that creates and manages an entirely automated synthetic consulting firm using AI agents. The system enables the creation of AI-powered "employees" that can be hired, assigned tasks, and managed through an intelligent orchestration system. Human users create high-level tasks in JIRA, which are then broken down and assigned to specialized AI agents that are dynamically hired based on their synthetic resumes and capabilities.

The goal is to build a fully autonomous workforce management system where AI agents can handle complex consulting tasks, learn from their experiences, and continuously improve their capabilities while maintaining cost efficiency through intelligent model execution strategies.

## Goals

1. **Automate Task Decomposition**: Enable automatic breakdown of high-level JIRA tasks into actionable sub-tasks
2. **Dynamic Agent Hiring**: Create a system that can generate job descriptions and hire AI agents based on synthetic resumes
3. **Intelligent Task Assignment**: Match tasks to existing agents or create new agents when capabilities are missing
4. **Cost-Effective Operations**: Implement consensus mechanisms and cost tracking to optimize model execution expenses
5. **Continuous Learning**: Enable agents to build experience and improve capabilities through completed work
6. **Audit Trail**: Maintain comprehensive tracking of all agent decisions, assignments, and task completions
7. **Scalable Architecture**: Build a modular system following SOLID principles with clear service boundaries

## User Stories

**As a Project Manager**, I want to create high-level tasks in JIRA so that the agentic system can automatically break them down and assign work to appropriate AI agents.

**As an Orchestration Agent**, I want to analyze incoming tasks and break them into sub-tasks so that specialized agents can handle specific components efficiently.

**As a Hiring Manager Agent**, I want to evaluate existing agent capabilities and create job descriptions for missing skills so that the workforce can adapt to new requirements.

**As a Recruiter Agent**, I want to generate synthetic resumes that match job requirements so that qualified candidates are available for hiring decisions.

**As a Manager Agent**, I want to evaluate agent performance and track costs so that I can optimize workforce efficiency and quality.

**As a System Administrator**, I want to monitor agent activities and costs so that I can ensure the system operates within budget and performance parameters.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Data Management
1. **The system must provide CRUD operations for job descriptions** including title, description, required skills, experience level, and associated prompts.
2. **The system must provide CRUD operations for synthetic resumes** including personal information, skills, experience, education, and performance history.
3. **The system must maintain associations between resumes and job applications** with status tracking (applied, interviewing, hired, rejected).
4. **The system must track active agent roster** including current resume, latest prompt configuration, assigned model, and execution parameters.

### Prompt Management
5. **The system must maintain a task prompt table** that stores templates and custom prompts for executing specific types of work.
6. **The system must maintain a resume prompt table** that stores prompts for generating agent personas and decision-making styles.
7. **The system must support both template-based and fully custom prompts** with variable substitution capabilities.

### Model and Cost Management
8. **The system must maintain a model catalog** with associated costs per execution, context size limits, and performance characteristics.
9. **The system must track model execution costs** per agent, per task, and aggregate across time periods.
10. **The system must implement configurable consensus mechanisms** allowing different numbers of model executions per agent type.
11. **The system must calculate and store total costs** for each task including all agent executions involved.

### Agent Lifecycle Management
12. **The system must evaluate existing agents for task suitability** using scoring and ranking algorithms before creating new agents.
13. **The system must support agent interview processes** through prompt-based conversations between hiring managers and candidates.
14. **The system must enable hiring manager feedback to recruiters** for iterative resume generation improvement.
15. **The system must track agent experience** by associating completed JIRA tickets with agent profiles for future capability assessment.

### Task and Assignment Management
16. **The system must integrate with JIRA** to receive high-level tasks and create sub-tasks through the orchestration agent.
17. **The system must support task dependency tracking** linking sub-tasks to parent tasks and tracking completion status with blocker management.
18. **The system must implement intelligent agent assignment** considering cost, capability, and availability.
19. **The system must provide task reassignment capabilities** when initial assignments prove ineffective.
20. **The system must handle model service failures** by creating Admin-assigned tickets for infrastructure issues and preventing dependent task execution until blockers are resolved.

### Audit and Monitoring
21. **The system must maintain comprehensive audit logs** of all agent decisions, task assignments, and hiring activities.
22. **The system must track agent performance metrics** including task completion rates, quality scores, and cost efficiency.
23. **The system must implement agent termination/replacement** for consistently failing agents through hiring of more expensive models or agents with different skill sets.

### API Architecture
24. **The system must follow SOLID principles** with clear separation between services and database access layers.
25. **The system must provide RESTful API endpoints** for all CRUD operations and system interactions.
26. **The system must implement proper authentication and authorization** for API access control.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Time-based performance metrics** - The system will not track or optimize for completion time since tasks can be parallelized
2. **External job board integration** - The system generates its own job postings and candidates internally
3. **Human interviewing interfaces** - All interviews are conducted through agent-to-agent prompt interactions
4. **Real-time collaboration tools** - Agents work asynchronously through the task assignment system
5. **Email or notification systems** - Communication happens through API calls and database updates
6. **Self-hosted LLM management** - Initial version assumes API-based model access with standard pricing
7. **Advanced RAG implementation** - While mentioned for future learning, complex retrieval systems are not part of initial scope
8. **Cost budget controls** - Model API cost controls will be handled externally, not within this system
9. **Data privacy for synthetic resumes** - No special handling required since all resume data is artificially generated
10. **Formal integration testing** - The system will self-optimize through natural selection of successful agents

## Technical Considerations

1. **Database Design**: Implement proper relational database structure with foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity between agents, tasks, resumes, and cost tracking
2. **Service Architecture**: Create separate microservices for HR management, task orchestration, cost tracking, and JIRA integration following SOLID principles
3. **Model Integration**: Design abstraction layer for different LLM providers to allow future flexibility in model selection
4. **Consensus Algorithm**: Implement multiple consensus mechanisms:
   - For discrete options: Simple vote counting with majority selection
   - For text/paragraph outputs: K-means clustering with silhouette analysis, selecting from the largest cluster with smallest residual distance
5. **Cost Calculation**: Create real-time cost tracking with proper attribution to tasks and agents, with natural bias toward smaller/cheaper models
6. **JIRA Integration**: Maintain loose coupling with JIRA API to allow for easy migration or integration with other project management systems
7. **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling to handle large numbers of concurrent agents and tasks
8. **Dependency Management**: Implement task blocking mechanisms that prevent execution of dependent tasks when blockers exist
9. **Quality Evaluation**: Support both objective metrics (TDD test completion for coding tasks) and subjective manager evaluation for SMART goal compliance
10. **Agent Specialization**: Allow natural specialization limits based on model context constraints and cost optimization

## Success Metrics

1. **Task Completion Rate**: Measure percentage of JIRA tasks successfully completed by the agentic system
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Track cost per completed task and compare against traditional consulting rates
3. **Agent Utilization**: Monitor percentage of active agents and their workload distribution
4. **Quality Scores**: Implement manager agent evaluation system to track work quality over time
5. **System Adoption**: Measure number of tasks routed through the agentic system vs. traditional methods
6. **Agent Learning Curve**: Track improvement in agent performance over time through experience accumulation
