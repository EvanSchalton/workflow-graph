### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.py` and `MyComponent.test.py` in the same directory).
- Use `python -m pytest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the pytest configuration.
- Follow the existing JIRA API structure as a template for service organization and patterns.
- All services should implement proper dependency injection and follow SOLID principles.
- Database models should use SQLAlchemy ORM with proper relationships and constraints.
